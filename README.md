A curated collection of research papers, benchmarks, and open-source projects on **Graph Engineering in the era of LLM Agents**. This repository accompanies the survey *[Graph Engineering in the Era of LLM Agents: From Individual Intelligence to System Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.21156)* and will be continuously updated.

Graph Engineering studies how explicit, dynamic, and evolving graph structures can organize tasks, coordinate heterogeneous agents, maintain runtime state, and support system evolution. The collection follows the survey's progression from **Model Intelligence**, through **Individual Intelligence**, to **System Intelligence**.

🤗 **Contributions are welcome.** If you find a missing resource or a relevant new work, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

**📃 Please [cite our paper](#-citation)** if you find this survey or repository helpful.

## 🎉 News

- **[2026-08]** We release our survey *[Graph Engineering in the Era of LLM Agents: From Individual Intelligence to System Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.21156)* and the accompanying resource collection.

## Overview

Graph Engineering provides a structured path from standalone model capability to coordinated system-level intelligence:

- **Model Intelligence** builds and adapts foundation-model capabilities through parameterized training, prompt engineering, and context engineering.
- **Individual Intelligence** equips a single agent with tools, memory, skills, runtime orchestration, and persistent interaction loops.
- **System Intelligence** organizes tasks, agents, runtime state, and system evolution through explicit graph structures, with ontology engineering providing a shared semantic layer.
